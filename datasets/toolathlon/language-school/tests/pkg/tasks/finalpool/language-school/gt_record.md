# Preprocess

1. Delete the previous cs_top10_us_2025.xlsx in workspace
2. Copy the format.xlsx in initial_workspace to workspace

# Evaluation
1. Change the whole check_local.py to adapt to the xlsx format files
2. Test whether the agent fills in the excel according to the rules in the prompt：
    a. If the generated answer has the different number of university with groundtruth,
    b. If the type of data is incorrect,
    c. Most requirements are from MSCS of every university. If it provides information of other programs,
        it will fail the test immediately.
3. Make the comparison more robust eg:
    a. 105 and 105.0
    b. stanford and Stanford (lowercase, space and symbol (except "_") will not affect the comparison)
        will not affect the comparison
